# Project4500
CIS4500 Project

Our idea for this project was motivated by the upcoming election and Pennsylvania’s status as a critical swing state in the election. We have all been targeted with a flurry of political ads over the past few months and became curious about if it would be possible to quantify the amount of money it takes in political ad spending to convert a voter.

Queries: 
For each candidate in a given year, calculate the total amount spent on the campaign and divide it by the total number of votes that candidate received to determine the cost per vote by state and overall. 
For each presidential election, compare cost per vote between the Democratic and Republican candidates at the state level, and darken/highlight the state by an amount proportional to the difference in cost per vote. 
Calculate how cost per vote has changed over multiple cycles in swing states. Identify the top 10 states by cost per vote over time. 
Calculate the cost per vote by spending category (e.g., TV, digital, ground)
Identify the top 10 states with the highest return on investment—identify states with the lowest cost per vote and compare those with the swing states that decided the election.
